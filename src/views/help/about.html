<h5>What is this site?</h5>
<div class="vspace"></div>
<p>In recent years, we've seen that the internet gives us the opportunity to reinvent a lot of things - I say things because there is really no limit to what can be reinvented. News, communication, information, discovery, entertainment - these are all being redefined in a way that makes them accessible to everyone with an internet connection. The services behind all these innovations have one key point in common: the content creator is not a company or organization; it is any person that chooses to create and share something. It is in this way that UANotes wants to redefine education.</p>
<div class="vspace"></div>
<p>UANotes aims to provide the tools for structured learning, but also for decentralized teaching. There is a lot of knowledge hidden by people whose title is not "teacher", and that is what we want to make available. In order to do this, we have to create an experience that clearly better facilitates learning than the classroom alone. We can't do this without your help. Thanks for using UANotes.</p>
